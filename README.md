ðŸŽ§ DJMixer â€“ Auto Vibe Detection & Playback from Songs
DJMixer is a Python-based tool that listens to a song, identifies its overall vibe (like slow, soothing, party, or mood-setting) using simple audio features, and then intelligently plays the segment of the track that best matches that vibe.

ðŸ’¡ Version 1 uses rule-based logic with librosa, pydub, and simpleaudio for analysis and playback.
ðŸš€ Version 2 (coming soon) will use a trained machine learning model for more accurate vibe prediction.
